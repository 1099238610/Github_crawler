            "body": "Hey, thanks for responding.\nRegarding the issue, I managed to get it working after some changes.\nI did a few things, and some seem to line up with your experience as well.First, I deleted everything.\nIts clear now to me that photonix stores basically everything in Postgres which is good, as it reduces the time to reinstall. On my unraid setup (using the containers listed in first post) only postgres11 stores any userdata, so I was able to wipe everything, delete all the configurations and start over. After that I saw I can just stop everything (photonix, redis & postgres) and delete postgres userdata, then start back up (postgres, redis, then photonix) and have a clean installation.The way I got everything working was I went through the photonix official  file and made sure I am using EXACTLY the same images, those being: ,  and .\nAfter that, I edited the unraid templates and tried to get everything inline with the  file.\nI also noticed that the instance refuses to work if a django secret is not set, it doesn't create one by itself as indicated. Considering so much fuss is made about known django secret keys, it seems weird that it will complain infinitely that no secret is set.Lastly, I used the default created postgres database, and I think this might also somehow be important.\nCreating a secondary database with all permissions (Using instructions in my previous comment) might well be an issue, but I haven't gone back to test this as I've been able to wipe and restart without issues. Still, would be a weird bug if that's the case that you have to dedicate an entire postgres instance or it will refuse to work as part of a shared instance.Can I ask what solution you went with in the end?\nI'm currently working through different solutions at the moment, with the intention/use-case of sharing self-hosted family photos amongst my family.",

I was just thinking a PUT request to /tags instead of /conversations/{conversation_id}/tags would make sense. Even for creation of new tags (not sure how it's done behind the scenese).When we add tags through X at the moment, if you add a bunch it seems to have a set list of a few through the spectrum but after some period of time it goes back to the start of that list, which is green I think. So if you add one every now and then it is looking like they would all be the same color anyway which feels a little like why bother. I could be wrong and that is just a coincidence though.At the moment we have a client who we are training to use X so they can add more content themselves, they are non-techinical and getting them to use an api is pretty much out.As a user myself I would see wanting an easier way to deal with tags, I think tags are a good feature and like using them, and having a personal/team color pattern for different types of tags was the first thought in my mind when adding them.

When crossing different types of lanes, the sensor will give the name of the lane crossed. Specifically, when crossing the curb line, the sensor will give the feedback signal of \"NONE\", which indicates the vehicle crossing the lane type called \"NONE\". Based on this principle, I could detect it when the ego vehicle crosses the curb line. However, in the official CARLA maps, the \"NONE\" signal occurs not only in crossing curb lines, but also in crossing some dashed white lines or dashed yellow lines. In this context, I cannot perfectly detect curb-line-crossing behaviors. Could somebody give insights on how to merely detect the curb line crossing behavior?Carla Version: 0.9.13\nPlatform: Win10",

We used the provided environment.py for changing the weather parameters.

They can also develop in .py files.This is not possible with Flask, Django, FastApi, Gradio, Dash or Streamlit.Panel is one of the 4 most popular data app frameworks in Python with more than 400.000 downloads a month. It's especially popular in the scientific community.Panel is used by for example Rapids to power CuxFilter, a CuDF based big data viz framework.An added benefit of adding a Panel Frontend is that afterwards supporting a BokehFrontend is almost copy paste.I can do the implementation and documentation, but would need help reviewing and similar.I can also promote the new opportunity to the Panel community.None.Coming sooncc ",

I think Mozilla's initiative is especially interesting if it's offline and can operate locally, with the same performance as if it was running in a \"cloud\". I am personally not at ease sending my voice over the Internet even with promises of it not being saved.I am curious what are blockers to this and propose tracking them here.Probably those could be around:How does this exactly work on the \"cloud\" side? What would it take moving the \"cloud\" side entirely on the client side?I would imagine it's possible to train a model using \"cloud\" resources and later execute that model locally.Thank you!",

And it doesn't run Python (without a lot of work).I think our emphasis is on routing things to web-based services. So if we could send an utterance to a MyCroft device, then that would be quite sensible. You'd need to configure your personal MyCroft device. But if MyCroft has a local web page where you can type in some text (or put it in the query string) then the configuration could be as simple as saying \"this is my MyCroft page\" with the appropriate page open.That would open a second question: which phrases do we forward to MyCroft? The easy thing is to give the device a name and require the user to say \"tell mycroft to [something]\". We could also consider a configurable fallback service (Google is essentially our fallback service), but I doubt MyCroft would be useful that way – it doesn't handle random queries particularly well. The fanciest would be for MyCroft to either publish some phrases, or dynamically tell us if it thinks it can parse a phrase well. There's some danger there in MyCroft being greedy about handling phrases, but it would be an interesting question to try to figure out.Lastly, we just take some of those skills and replicate them here. Whenever possible we'd like to forward things to a web-based service, though in some cases implementing something natively is helpful, for instance there's reasons for us to have native timers.",

(There are three phases: \"Listening\", \"One Second\", and then \"Sorry, there was an issue\".  Each phase has a different dialog height and a different position of the gear.)EXPECTED RESULTS:\nThe gear should be at a consistent position so that it is easy to click.",
